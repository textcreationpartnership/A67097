            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Othing is manifeſted in Scripture to be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred then an Oath; which though made to Man and proceeding from Man, yet being made with relation to God is called <hi>The Oath of God, Exod.</hi> 22. as a Principall part of Gods Worſhip, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord and ſwear by his name, Deut.</hi> 10. And it is moſt juſtly called a <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> ſince thereby the juſt ſwearer glorifieth God, by profeſſing, Firſt, his Omniſcience, as the only ſearcher of his heart to know whether he ſweares rightly or not. Secondly, his inviolable juſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the unjuſt ſwearer; and Thirdly, his omnipotency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable power, to take vengeance upon every Godleſſe viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of an Oath: and Godleſſe he muſt needs be, who obſerveth not all the properties of an Oath which God himſelfe hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; even theſe three recorded, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear in Iuſtice, in Judgement, and in Truth.</hi> Firſt, in <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> that the caſe be neceſſary and <hi>juſt,</hi> whereunto I am to be ſworn. Secondly, in <hi>Judgement,</hi> that I know it to be ſuch; becauſe whoſoever doth it doubtfully <hi>condemneth himſelfe. Rom.</hi> 14.5, 22, 23. Laſtly in <hi>Truth,</hi> abhorring from all deceitfulneſſe of ſpeech; either by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball

Thus much of the ſubſtance and circumſtances of Lawfull ſwearing.</p>
               <p>We are to bring the new Oath to this divine Teſt, to trie it whether it be true coyne or counterfeit.</p>

The reaſon here pretended is (as the denomination ſheweth) <hi>The Popiſh Army of the King;</hi> now the denomination of every thing is taken either from that which is greater in Quantity, or in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency for worth, and value. But if I ſhould think that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Kings is therefore more <hi>excellent</hi> becauſe <hi>Popiſh,</hi> this were to denominate my ſelfe unworthy in oppoſing them, or if it be meant in reſpect of the Quantity, as if in the Army againſt the Parliament the greater number were Papiſts; this is as diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe the whole hoaſt at <hi>Oxford,</hi> both Captains and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Souldiers (as is divulged) have taken the Oath, for defence of the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed. And ſcarce any one Troop of Papiſts hath been named in all the reſt of the Armies on this ſide <hi>Trent.</hi> As for the Northern parts (if the aſſeverations of ſome may be credited) not two Regiments of ſixteen can be accounted which profeſſe themſelves Popiſh.

He is an utter Enemy of Gods true Religion, a violator of all ſacred Vowes, Oathes, and Covenants? And can I yet be ſaid to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine His Honour?

               <p>Firſt, How with the Introduction, <hi>viz.

And thirdly, how can I call it a Popiſh Army, when the more principall part muſt give the denomination? when it is confeſt and manifeſt, that the better part by much, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by farre are Proteſtants, and ſworn contrary to all Popiſh Plots.

               <p>Againe, how can it conſiſt with the Limitation, <hi>i. e.
